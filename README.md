# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game with player vs player (PvP) and player vs unbeatable AI modes. The AI uses the minimax algorithm, making it unbeatable. The game is coded in Python and utilizes the Pygame module for the graphical user interface.

## Game Instructions
- Press 'g' to change the game mode (PvP or AI).
- Press '0' to set AI level to 0 (random moves).
- Press '1' to set AI level to 1 (impossible to beat).
- Press 'r' to restart the game.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Pygame module
- Numpy Moudle
```bash
pip install pygame
```
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## How to Run
Run the game script: 
```bash
python3 tictactoe.py
```

## Game Features
- Two game modes: Player vs Player and Player vs AI.
- Unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm.
- Simple and intuitive controls for changing game modes, AI levels, and restarting the game.

## Acknowledgements
The implementation of the minimax algorithm for the unbeatable AI is based on the principles of game theory.
